Hello everybody, welcome. I would like to welcome you to the new moon of Scorpio and We're gonna talk a little bit about that so we can get the best out of this month month of Scorpio Collectively and of course individually, so let's go right into it Scorpio is known for its power its intensity if you know anyone born under the sign of Scorpio well, I don't probably don't have to tell you that it's intense can be intense and There's a reason for that Scorpio by the way is known as one of the most powerful months and The new moon of Scorpio is also considered among the Kabbalist one of the most powerful days of the year without being a specific holiday and so It's a lot of positive energy in the new moon of Scorpio But in the rest of Scorpio, it's best to kind of I mean, it's okay. It's not a negative month, but You need to be careful and I'll explain to you what I mean exactly so again intensity is the name of the game another Fact Fun fact, let's say is on the 17th day of lunar Scorpio again Not the 17th day on the English calendar, but the 17th day of lunar Scorpio is the flood of Noah. That's the day according to the Bible when the flood occurred In the Noah story and it was destruction Destruction as the result of water now water is generally a life-giving force Okay, and it's interesting because if you read the Bible text, we just read began the Bible again in Genesis Bereshit and in the first day of Creation we read something very interesting about water that the Spirit of God Hovered over the waters the ruach Elohim and a half it up in a Hamaim What does it even mean the Spirit of God hovered over the waters now? There was no discussion about creation of water No doesn't exist It's almost like water just seemed to appear out of nowhere on the first day of creation It doesn't say that water was created. What it does say is the Spirit of God whatever that means again Elohim was Hovering over the waters. All right, and What we should understand the first thing we can understand from this is the power of water exists in Scorpio and We know also that Scorpio is a water sign. No. No, what does that have to do with anything? we know that Those born under the sign of Scorpio, I mean we can learn from them They can come at you at any time With a lot of intensity, let's say again generally powerful people, especially the women I I don't want to say more so than the men. Of course, it depends on the men, but it is one of those Constellations that the men and women are different in born under Scorpio. Also Leo Also Pisces, you know, so there are certain constellations where the men and women Are different we won't say better or worse, but act differently within that Constellation example would be Leo Leo women are certainly more powerful or controlling Generally, it's not a rule but Leo men can be more lazy because that's how it is in the jungle, right a Leo Lion kind of sits around and is the king where the woman? Lion the lioness goes out for the kill and She takes care of the young and the man, you know, he supervises so There is a difference also because when a constellation is different and again, it's not always the case But it is in some cases because women are innately internally Judgment men are internally mercy again. We can't go into now all the ramifications of that women externally are inherently mercy where men externally are Judgment, they are clothed in judgment. So Again, we are male and female are reverse in case anyone has any questions What is a male and what is a female a man and a woman? Well, they are very different They have different innate energy forces But of course you must understand things on an energetic level not on a superficial, you know, or ideological level That's not where we are. We you know, we want to understand energetically things internally because that's what's running the show the internal of things the you know metaphysical world is running the Physical world and so to that, you know if we understand that then we understand that Scorpio women can be much more Judgmental than Scorpio men it can come but on the other side. They're also more powerful and positive with their energy Potentially again not to say that men aren't you know, the men Scorpios are not powerful They can be again also very powerful, but the tendency is the women have more intensity, let's put it that way and Because of that intensity again if you know intimately a female Scorpio Well, you know, it's good to be on the good side of that person all the time you know, you don't want to be on the receiving end of the Dean the judgment because they can finish you in a second and you know But it's interesting that you know, my teacher always used to say if you get the business That was the expression if you get the business from a Scorpio listen listen to what they're saying because they're telling you the truth and They are truth tellers in that sense Because they hate lies. They don't like lying at All now there's a reason for this, okay Obviously, there's a metaphysical reason for this because in a certain way they are Connected very much with the truth. The sign of Scorpio is Connected with the truth. So if we go into it again from the you know Metaphysical side or the Kabbalistic side, which we'll talk some secrets about the month of Scorpio We understand that the constellation of Scorpio first off comes after all the holidays the Rosh Hashanah the Yom Kippur and the holiday of Sukkot have been all completed and the spiritual light while When we've completed all those events, there's a tremendous Spiritual After-effect if you will as a result of those holidays and We call it an abundance of mercy. There is an abundance of mercy What is what what is the meaning of this? Abundance of mercy and what is it connected to? So mercy is characterized by the element of Water from the three elements three elements and and and according to the Kabbalah, there are three elements and then the result element three causal elements, which is fire water and Fire water and air okay, air fire and water and the Manifestation Element as the result of those are yes, you guessed it earth So earth is not considered a root element, but the result of air fire and water element obviously You know Something is more causal and something is more effect Effectual so and that's why earth is slower it but it manifests things, but it's not Since it's not cause cause is more quickly it's more fast right fire is very fast air is fast water is Flowing earth is still stand still again, but it manifests That's why we must have the earth to manifest things whether we're speaking Spiritually or we are speaking physically you put the seed in the earth in order to manifest the tree or whatever it is and Things that are manifestation are considered Energetically earth even if they're not like a woman is also part earth She's a manifest or but she's also part mercy. Anyway, I don't want to I don't want to confuse things sorry, but so the thing with Scorpio is there is an abundance of mercy as the result of the holidays now, there's two sides to that because the Force of mercy is present and the force of fire is also present as I'll explain in a moment because you have fire and water you have the intensity of fire and the mercy of water and let let me explain how that Bears out now fire and water can both be either negative or positive Right, we understand that fire burns Obviously, that's the negative side. So too much intensity of heat not good But on the other hand fire we need fire fire is heat is warmth is Life son. I mean again, we need that And the same with water water is life-giving without water. There is you know, no life But on the other hand too much water is a flood and the flood destroys and that's the Noah and the flood story which again Occurs in Scorpio on the 17th day of Lunar Scorpio. So again, that's too much of a good thing It's not a good thing. So what is it that's going on really in? intrinsically in Scorpio to cause these forces both to be present creation and destruction and Destruction and it's literally the power of creation or the power of destruction in the same place You know, it's interesting about most Scorpions when they come into a new situation Be it a new job or a new situation Whatever the case may be their tendency is to destroy everything first and then then rebuild it Okay, the way they would like to see it the way they feel will be you know much much better of course in their image so to speak so destroy flatten it out and Rebuild. All right. We're not here to discuss the tikkun or the spiritual karmic corrections of Scorpio But we have to understand the same energy exists as the constellation. We're all affected by it So what we want to understand for this month is how to deal with it So there's this abundance of mercy this abundance of mercy is the result of the holidays all the holidays Energy this abundance of mercy that again is the result from the holidays that we had in Libra Manifest in Scorpio. That's why there's no need for a holiday this in there's so much energy in Scorpio It's difficult to deal with except in the new moon the first two days of the new moon Which if you're watching this today Sorry the date escapes me but on the new moon of Scorpio the first two days of Scorpio Are the most powerful days on the calendar without having to be specific holidays, but the rest of the month it can be Unhinged. Okay energy can be like, you know running amok unless we know how to harness it and then it's amazingly powerful I mean for me, I love the month of Scorpio. Not a lot of people, you know, not everybody loves Scorpio I do Why because it tells the truth and I'm interested in that. I'm interested in understanding the truth about myself What does that mean? And here's what to pay attention to in the month of Scorpio pay attention to all the messengers that will be sent to you because invariably on a personal level or Environmental level, but I'm not going to get into the you know discussions of Wars and so on the things that are going on currently I want to stick with the personal level of things because when we change our inside the world around us will also change Messengers will come to us this month to tell us things we may not want to hear but know There's a true message for you. Why because it's Scorpio Scorpio will tell you the truth Scorpio will tell you what you need to do Scorpio will tell you what you shouldn't be doing the message is Scorpio especially should be paid attention to why because the Constellation of Scorpio is a truth teller it might come across harsh But you have to you know, stick to your guns. Don't speak. Don't talk back. Take it in It can feel like a fire Okay can feel intense like fire like burning like you're being burnt but accept it as a purification Accepted as a fire That's purifying you and making you ready for what you need to do next for your next step in life Even yes It has that power for the next stage of what you need to be ready for to go to your next highest Level if you take it on that way without, you know, I don't know defending yourself without Again I'm talking about a harsh criticism. I'm talking about, uh, you know Something that might come out of nowhere Someone that gives you something or tells you something or insults you again. It's to help you purify I'm not talking about abuse from anybody Okay, God forbid but we're talking about normal human interactions could be at work could be something your boss needs to tell you Something your loved one needs to tell you your partner needs to tell you and might be out of the blue Again, and you can feel you know what? This is this is too much. This is too harsh. This is a you know, I know I'm gonna you know, and I'm gonna tell them what's wrong with them. No big mistake, especially this month in general It's a mistake to answer back right away. The first the first step in Spiritual growth is learning how to take the criticism even it's harsh criticism Even it's insulting even it's out of place Especially if it's out of place, especially if it's out of the blue why when it's out of the blue We should know it's coming from somewhere the universe wants to give us a message But you know, our ego is hurt and you know all the whatever they're wrong and Yeah, maybe but they're not there's always going to be a truth in the message And that's what I need to hear if you're busy defending yourself It means your ego has already been activated and your ego is already Fighting back and you're not gonna get anything out of this message So kind of you know, it's almost like, you know, so the light wasted its time with you So, you know, maybe you won't get any messages for whatever I don't know how long because depending on how much your intent on Fighting against what the cosmos wants to teach us or show us relate to us. There's always messages Available again in general again when we get those types of messages We should number one listen and then you know after three days five days a week If there's something you feel that needs to be said to the other person and so on Okay, I'm not saying don't say anything never say anything I'm not saying that but I'm saying step one is to always listen take it in accept the message Find what it means to you Don't kick it out completely Because again, there's always light there intensity Judgment is light without the covering. What does that mean? Well Scorpio? again, especially Scorpio Scorpio is called a Krav in Hebrew a Krav, what is a crop the scorpion the scorpion now in Hebrew? the the four letters that make up the Scorpio a Krav is iron cough race bet So you have iron and bet at the end of the word for those of you who know Hebrew I in bet 72 which if you study the Kabbalah that should be a significant number to you 72 that relates to the 72 names But the two letters in the middle are coupe and race cough and races car Cold cold and so we've just described the letters which Completely can describe the Scorpio, especially if that individual is not a spiritual individual Okay, not spiritually tuned Extreme fire, which is the iron bet the light of wisdom, which is pure light. It's pure fire It's pure judgment and incidentally the letters that of the month also our Dean judgment Dalit and known Dalit for Mars the war planet and known which is Stands for falling the Fila, which is the constellation of Scorpio. So again, there's there's a lot of different things We could get into now. We can't because it's already you know, it will be too much but there's nature of judgment Completely in this month fire, but again light is also judgment We don't understand that necessarily light must have a harness It must have the mercy to balance the judgment, but pure judge pure light is judgment It's a pure judgment, which is not a bad thing But it's only the fact that we're not ready for it. We can't handle pure light. Nobody cares like pure sunlight Can you look directly into pure sunlight? Can you take pure sunlight? No, none of us can we're not built for it Doesn't mean it's bad, but we need the what we call the light of mercy. We need the ability we need Insulation to be able to handle it Electricity is a wonderful thing but putting our finger in the socket is not a wonderful thing We can't handle it. We need a receptacle We need a an ability to receive it and that's why I said generally During the middle of the month in the new moon you have that it's automatic that's why it's so powerful the first two days of the month, but the rest of the month doesn't have a it doesn't have a Insulation. So what can we do to benefit the most from this huge energy in the month of Scorpio? Well, I will tell you it's what I said, it's being willing to handle and accept the heat the heat of the judgment the heat of the truth the fire of being able to handle The insult because when we do that invariably we're gonna get it from somewhere and then we'll react to it And when we react to it, we will set off a chain reaction so if you're able to be strong enough not to fall into the traps of Whatever the insults might be whatever the truth even again even and especially but you're right and they're wrong And the situation is wrong. No, and I'm I'm including situations into this equation, too Not just individuals but situations that come and they're not to your liking But the situation is somehow giving you the truth Okay again if it relates to you personally and your own tikkun your own karmic Correction if you will when it affects you personally, it's true for you and you need to hear it There's something you need to do something you need to learn again accepting these things in this way in the month of Scorpio and Enables you to handle the tremendous light of Scorpio, which is also Available and you will see the benefits shortly after but if you fall into the trap You'll get tangled in a web and you'll think Scorpio. Oh my god It's such a terrible month and you know, it might play out that way again Not because it's a terrible month But because you become entangled with the judgment and it becomes like, you know Chain reaction you react to this and something else happens because you didn't handle this and something else So it's it's true. We should walk a fine line But if we're ready with love and love is mercy mercy handles this energy of judgment if you're ready with sharing capability if you are willing to accept the difficulty or painful situation Which is also Awakening the light of mercy that's present. It's already here. We don't need to look for the light of mercy We just need to you know, push the buttons then this month again Like I tell you I love this month this month can turn out to be one of the most powerful Months of the year for you full of light and blessings and it can feed you You know and help you make manifest all the light of the holidays and everything else that's present for us now again so let's do our best not to fall into those traps of truth and Let's get the most out of the month of Scorpio Khodoshtov. Have an amazing month everybody Be blessed and I'll see you very soon in the next video
